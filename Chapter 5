Chapter 5
Written by lijunhan

It was something before chenzhizhen and his 496*s. As for his naughtier and naughtier behaviors, this special chapter has been written to show his "abnormal" and "significant" talents in stiring things up, and the great varieties of things he had ever involved in.

Just during the May Day, another hotspot has been risen: fangzhijian, one of the greatest OIers in the room, got a nickname Fang Zhi G***!

For fangzhijian is still very angry about this now, we did not write the name out, so just focus on the story.

However, even if everyone was happy calling fangzhijian face to face, chenzhizhen is not pleased. He seemed to want fangzhijian to "say" the name himself.

So, when fangzhijian went to the toilet and forgot to lock his computer, chenzhizhen rushed to his computer, and send something about his nickname to the board as quick as he can.

When fangzhijian came back, he only saw the open board and a snicker-smiled chenzhizhen.

After realizing what had happened, fangzhijian howled like a wounded dog, and leaped from the ground toward chenzhizhen.

After that, chenzhizhen seemed to lose interest in this kind of thing, and focused on rank1s again, so Chapter 4's story happened.
