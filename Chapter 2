"Oh?" said luosiyuan，"I can hack you in a minute! If i cannot,I'm a bald man!"
but he did not manage to work out the testpoint in one minute.

So chenzhizhen expanded!

Chenzhizhen found another two problems and got the data on darkbzoj.tk,and got the rank 1 like a piece of shi*.

He became stronger and stronger in this way.

In one problem which zhouziwei had rank1,the output was too big so he could not put the output in his code.

So he searched the Internet and found a rank1 solution on Luogu,and submitted it on oj.

Zhouziwei was suprised when he found "88ms 2.5kb" in front of his "150ms 1.2kb".

He asked chenzhizhen how he did it, and he said:"WO QU LUOGU SHANG ZHAO DE！"

After 2 days,rank 1 of 62 problems became his.

"Tutou!" said weilinxuan2020.
