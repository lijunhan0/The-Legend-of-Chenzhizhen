On May 13th the hero of the computer room--zhouberwei, he starter the "Clash Huang&Zhen I".Chenzhizhen was punished. He was told not to get Rank1s by using bald ways.

However,chenzhizhen,who is very stubborn, didn't want to let wlx,gyh,zzw,lsy and many other people to have Rank1s.
An idea flashed into his bald head.

He sent out the pascal code of 1120 and asked people from the room across to get the Rank1 from gyh,and he succeeded.Because a man with no ***** named tmz and -1 man named fzw tried and got Rank1.

Gyh was angry and got the Rank1 of 1919 from tmz, because he thought tmz was too young too simple, sometimes naive.

However,chenzhizhen got a Rank1 code and sent it to tmz secretly,and tmz got the Rank1.

If you live with a lame person you will learn to limp.I wish students from the room across can stop getting useless Rank1s by using czz ways, it is all right if you do it by yourself, but if you do like czz,you will be even balder than him.

A crow is never the whiter for washing herself often!  

Maybe "Clash Huang&Zhen II" will happen if czz continues being like this.
