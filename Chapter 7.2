Even chenzhizhen was punished hard, this story must be published.

In Chapter 7.1 we talked about chenzhizhen and shik's story, but his ambition won't stop just there: he then shouted, "Weilinxuan, I rather fancy your rank1s."

wlx felt a bit scared but still, he was a bit doubtful about whether czz will really get his rank1s.

To make wlx believe it, chenzhizhen found FOUR problems which weilinxuan owned their rank1s, got the fastest code on luogu, and even made TWO tables in just one of them!

Now you can imagine wlx's feelings and his helplessness......

He then scratched down all chenzhizhen's rank1 problems and send them on board.

Below that, he wrote: "Come on, everyone! This is part of the mission!"
